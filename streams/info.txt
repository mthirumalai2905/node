`Streams` are objects that let you read data from a source
or write data to a destination in continuous fashion. In Node.js
there are four types of Streams

Streaming means listening to music or watching video in `realtime`,
instead of downloading a file to your computer and wathcing it later

Readable - Stream which is used for read operation

Writable - Stream which is used for write operation

Duplex - Stream which can be used for both read and write operation

Transform - A Type of duplex stream where the output is computed from the input

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each type of Stream is an EventEmitter instance and throws several events at
different instance of times. For example, some fo the commonly used events are-

data - This event is fired when there is data available to read

end  - This event is fired when there is no more data to read

error - This event is fired when there is any error recieved or writing data.

finish - This event is fired when all the data has been flushed to underlying system
